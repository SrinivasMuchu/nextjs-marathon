<br/><br/><strong>6.2 No Refund Policy</strong><br/>

 Upon successful purchase and full payment, each Buyer is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, perpetual license to use the purchased CAD File solely for the Buyer&apos;s own internal, personal, or commercial purposes, unless a different license is expressly stated by the Seller in the applicable listing.
 No ownership or intellectual-property rights are transferred to the Buyer under this license; all rights not expressly granted remain with the Seller.

                    8.1 Ownership of Seller Content
 Each Seller retains all right, title, and interest in and to the CAD Files and any associated intellectual-property rights therein. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed as transferring or assigning ownership of any CAD File to Marathon-OS or to any Buyer.
<br/>8.2 Marathon-OS as Facilitator Only
 Marathon-OS acts solely as a technological intermediary and marketplace facilitator between Sellers and Buyers. Marathon-OS does not claim, verify, or assert ownership over any CAD File uploaded to the Platform, and does not independently review or validate the originality, authenticity, or ownership of such files.
<br/>8.3 Seller Responsibility and Representations
 Sellers are solely and exclusively responsible for ensuring that their CAD Files and listings do not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, or other intellectual-property or proprietary right of any third party. Each Seller represents and warrants that they possess all necessary rights and licenses to upload, list, and sell their CAD Files through the Platform.
<br/>8.4 Limitation of Liability for IP Disputes
 Marathon-OS disclaims all liability arising from any intellectual-property dispute between Users. Without limiting the foregoing, Marathon-OS shall not be liable for any claim relating to copyright, trademark, patent, or other intellectual-property rights in connection with content uploaded or sold by Sellers through the Platform.
<br/>8.5 Takedown and Complaint Procedure
 If Marathon-OS receives a credible complaint alleging that a CAD File infringes third-party rights, Marathon-OS may, in its sole discretion, remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content, suspend the Seller’s Account, and/or take other appropriate actions in accordance with applicable law.

                </p>
                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p className={styles['privacy-info']}>
                    9.1 Service Provided “As Is.”
 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Platform and all services, content, and features provided through it are offered by Marathon-OS on an “as is,” “as available,” and “with all faults” basis, without any warranties, representations, or conditions of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise. Marathon-OS expressly disclaims all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, as well as any warranty arising from course of dealing or usage of trade.
<br/>9.2 Exclusion of Damages.
 To the fullest extent permitted by law, Marathon-OS, its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and licensors shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, including without limitation:

 <br/>b. System failure, downtime, or service interruption;
 <br/>c. Intellectual-property disputes or alleged infringement relating to Seller content;
 <br/>d. Loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings; or
 <br/>e. User-to-user disputes or any acts or omissions of third-party payment processors, hosting providers, or integration partners.
These limitations apply regardless of the theory of liability—whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise—and even if Marathon-OS has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br/>9.3 Aggregate Liability Cap.
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the aggregate liability of Marathon-OS for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Platform shall not exceed the total amount paid by you to Marathon-OS during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to such claim.
<br/>9.4 Jurisdictional Limitations.
 Because some jurisdictions do not allow certain warranty disclaimers or liability exclusions, the foregoing limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

                </p>
                <h2>10. Refund Policy</h2>
                <p className={styles['privacy-info']}>
                    All purchases of CAD Files made through the Platform are final, non-cancellable, and non-refundable.
                    Because CAD Files constitute intangible digital goods that are delivered instantly upon purchase, Marathon-OS is unable to provide returns, exchanges, or credits once a file has been made available for download or access.
                    Buyers are therefore urged to review all listing information carefully before completing any transaction.
                </p>

                    <strong>11.4 Changes to Commission Structure.</strong><br/>
                    Marathon-OS reserves the right to revise its commission rate or introduce additional service fees upon reasonable prior notice to Sellers. Any continued use of the Platform after such notice constitutes acceptance of the updated fee structure.
