                <p>
                At present, Marathon-OS does not charge for access to its tools or for 
                downloading CAD files via the marketplace. However, the hardware platform 
                offered as part of Marathon-OS is a paid service. Therefore, there are no 
                purchases eligible for refunds at this time.
                <br/>
                Once monetization features are introduced, the refund policy will be updated 
                accordingly. The general principles will be:


                     </p>
                     <ol>
                    <li><strong>Digital Products:</strong> Due to the nature of digital downloads, all purchases of CAD files or similar assets will be considered final and non-refundable unless otherwise specified.</li>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Services (if any):</strong> 
                    Any future subscription charges will be subject to clear cancellation terms, and partial refunds may not be provided for unused periods unless required by law.</li>
                   
                    <li><strong>Creator Transactions:</strong> 
                    Marathon-OS acts as an intermediary platform. Buyers are responsible for verifying creator content 
                    and <strong> MARATHON TECHNOLOGIES PRIVATE LIMITED </strong> does not guarantee refunds for disputes unless they involve 
                    clear violation of platform policy..</li>
                   
                </ol>
