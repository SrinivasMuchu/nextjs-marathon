                        <h2>Introduction of Part Number Nomenclature</h2>
                        <p>Part Number format/nNomenclature is the systematic method used to assign unique identifiers also
                            called as part numbers or codes to parts,
                            components, items, products within an inventory, manufacturing, or engineering system.</p>
                        <p>Nomenclature mainly contains a series of characters ( numbers, alphabets or a combination) often
                            embedding useful information on details like category,
                            specifications, material, size, version, etc.</p>
                        <p>For example, the part number used in the company might have the format like
                        </p>
                        <span>XYZ- SSB-001 where ;
                        </span>

                        <li>"XYZ" could indicate manufacturer,</li>
                        <li>"SSB" represents a stainless steel brake.</li>
                        <li>"001" could represent category, type, function.</li>
                        <span>The nomenclature in simple words is a way to encode specific information about each part so as to make it easier to track, manage, identify, ensure consistency, avoid redundancy, etc.
                        </span>

                        <h2>Importances of a Well Defined Part Number Format:</h2>
                        <p>It is crucial to follow the structured part number format for industries like aerospace, automotive, manufacturing and supply chain management for accuracy, traceability and efficiency. Thus, the companies assign unique identifiers instead of solely relying on descriptive names because of the several practical reasons like:
                        </p>
                        <li>Efficiency in Inventory Management: A structured nomenclature allows for quick identification and tracking of the inventories.</li>
                        <li>Faster Maintenance and Service: Reduces downtime in repairs as technicians can quickly identify and replace the correct parts.
                        </li>
                        <li>Eliminating Errors: Reduces mix-ups between similar parts, preventing costly mistakes.</li>
                        <li>Enhances Supply Chain Efficiency: Helps suppliers with accurate ordering and procurement and reduces the miscommunication between the suppliers, manufacturers and vendors.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ensures Compliance and Quality Control: Helps in ensuring adherence to industry standards and regulations and prevents counterfeit parts from entering the supply chain.
                        </li>
                        <li>Better BOM (Bill of Materials) Management: Ensures accurate documentation and easier traceability in production.
                        </li>
                        <li>Enhancing Engineering and Design Workflows: Avoids duplication and streamlines the reuse of existing parts.
                        </li>
                        <p>Moreover, unique part numbers are practically the best solution to the chaos of complexity.
                            The use of it simplifies the management, avoids confusion and duplication, ensures accuracy,
                            improves communication and supports operational efficiency.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Most common approaches and strategies of Part Number Format:</h2>
                        <span>The Common Approaches to Part Number Format or Nomenclature are as follows:
                        </span>
                        <li>Sequential Numbering: Simple numbering system (e.g., 01, 02, 03) with no embedded meaning which is used mostly by small companies with low inventories.
                        </li>
                        <li>Intelligent Part Numbering: Embeds meaning into the number like size, material, function (e.g., STL-BRK-2025-001 where STL = Steel, BRK = Brake, 2025 = Year, 001 = Serial Number).
                        </li>
                        <li>Hybrid Systems: A mix of intelligent and sequential numbering, offering some structure
                            without excessive complexity. (e.g. XYZ- SSB-001 where XYZ - Name of the Manufacturer, SSB-Stainless
                            Steel Brake, 001- Serial Number)
                        </li>
                        <p>While choosing among the above approaches, it's important to consider key
                            points such as volume, legacy systems, complexity and human vs machine use.
                            The best part number format depends on the size of the company and the usage of the components.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Challenges of Poor Part Numbering Practices</h2>
                        <p>The poor numbering practices deteriorate efficiency, traceability and scalability. Here are the most common challenges, the company faces when the number format fails:
                        </p>
                        <li>Confusion and misidentification: If the system is unstructured, finding the right part can be
                            time-consuming causing the project's delay or failures.</li>
                        <li>
                            Scalability Problems: If the numbering system is not designed with future growth in mind then the company might face difficulties in automation and it will be hard to expand the system.

                        </li>
                        <li>Duplicate and Redundant Part Creation: Without clear rules, companies often end up creating multiple versions of the same part.
                        </li>
                        <li>Confusion in Purchasing and Inventory Management: Lack of standardization leads to procurement errors and supply chain inefficiencies.
                        </li>
                        <li>Compliance and Regulatory Risks: Non-standard numbering can make compliance audit more difficult with chances of heavy fines and also the certification issue of
                            components making it harder to track.</li>
                        <li>Issues with Legacy Data Migration: When companies grow or shift to new systems, unstructured part numbers can cause serious integration issues.
                        </li>
                        <p>The root causes of poor number format is due to poor planning, over-optimization and neglecting the users with the system. A poor number format is not just the label problem but the business problem.

                        <h2>Best Practices for Setting Up a Part Numbering System
                        </h2>
                        <p>A well-defined and structured part numbering system is very essential for efficient manufacturing, inventory management, procurement and engineering processes.  The main goal is to create a part number format that is unique, informative, adaptable, efficient eliminating the ambiguity, time and cost. So here are the best practices to be followed:
                        </p>
                        <li>Keep it simple yet informative.
                        </li>
                        <li>Adopting a standardized numbering system (intelligent or sequential part number format)</li>
                        <li>
                            {`Avoid using special characters like !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, (, ), {, }, [, ], \\, |, <, >, /, ~ as they may cause issues in databases.`}
                        </li>



                        <li>Ensure consistency of the number format (e.g. prefix, length) across the organization.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use a scalable format that accommodates future growth.
                        </li>
                        <li>Ensure cross system compatibility
                        </li>
                        <li>Implementing governance rules to prevent ad hoc changes
                        </li>
                        <li>Leverage software tools like <a href='https://marathon-os.com' target='_blank'> marathon-os.com</a> to enforce rules of numbering (e.g. ERP, PDM or PLM Systems)

                        </li>
                        <li>Train employees on the system to ensure compliance and proper usage.
